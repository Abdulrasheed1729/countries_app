# countries_app

A simple mobile app that fetches data from the [**RestCoutries**](https://restcountries.com) rest [API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to display different datas about each the countries of the world.

## Code ðŸ’»

The codebase follows the layered architecture folder structure which is as below,

```
lib
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ colors
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rest_countries_api
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ models
â”œâ”€â”€ views
â””â”€â”€ widgets
```
The `views` folder contains the different pages in the app, and the `widgets` contains the diffenrent shared `Widgets` and components used in the app, which makes it easy to add new screens. 

In the `core` folder we have the different configurations used throught the lifecycle of the app.
